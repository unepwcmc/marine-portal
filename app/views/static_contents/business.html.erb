            <p>Reducing risk, increasing sustainability</p>
        </li>
        <li class="information">
            <p>The world’s oceans and coasts are becoming ever smaller as users of ocean space compete for marine resources and services. Biodiversity is the foundation of ecosystem services to which human well-being is directly linked. Biodiversity is a core component of sustainable development, and maintaining a well functioning, diverse ecosystem is key to sustaining developing economies. </p>

            <p>From a business perspective, biodiversity risk management, the process of understanding and mitigating environmental and social risks of projects, is essential for effective project implementation. Integrated access to information on the location and distribution of critical marine ecosystems and sites important for biodiversity helps reduce risk and associated liability for businesses operating in ocean and coastal waters.</p>

            <p>Effective biodiversity risk management contributes to a company’s license to operate, as well as its access to natural resources, capital and insurance, markets, and human capital. Increasingly, national legislation demands effort is made to reduce the biodiversity footprint of industrial operations before a license to operate is granted. </p>

            <p>Most International laws and regulations are imposed through countries that are signatories to international targets and agreements, such as the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Businesses need to understand how these environmental agreements apply to them, and recognise the business opportunities available to differentiate their company through responsible environmental behaviour and good environmental stewardship.  </p>

            <p>Based on the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Performance Standards, over 65 financial institutions have adopted the Equator Principles (EPs) as a set of guidelines to ensure EP financed projects are undertaken in a manner that is socially responsible and reflects sound environmental management practices. With over 85% of global project finance transactions now evaluated against the EP standards, both investors and operators incorporate biodiversity management as a de facto component of a Project lifecycle.  </p>

            <p>Ocean industry requires accurate and up to date biodiversity information to support critical business decision making. A recent meeting of global ocean industry leaders highlighted the need for better scalability, extent, and quality of data for marine spatial planning, and the lack of availability of data to inform best practice in corporate ocean responsibility was repeatedly raised. UNEP-WCMC’s Global Marine Data Partnership puts UNEP-WCMC in the forefront as a key partner to help fill this gap, and provides a means to further engage marine industry on data needs. The Ocean Data Viewer will allow companies to avoid or mitigate threats to biodiversity arising from their operations as well as sustainably manage renewable natural resources through access critical site-scale ocean and coastal data, allowing decision-makers to incorporate important biodiversity priorities into their risk assessment procedures for existing and potential operations. </p>
